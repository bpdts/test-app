* **Contributor:** Add new version for your pull request by incrementing the current version +1. Add list of changes annotated with the most appropriate keyword describing your change (`ADDED`, `CHANGED`, `BUGFIX`, `SECURITY`, `PERFORMANCE`, `DOCUMENTATION`, `PIPELINE`).
When incrementing the version number consider the following:

    1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
    3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
    4. 
<!-- Keywords: 
 ADDED - Introduction of a new feature or aspect that did not previously exist. 
 CHANGED - Enhancement or change to an existing feature.
 FIXED - Fixing of an existing bug without changing functionality. 
 SECURITY - Relating to any security enhancement, closure of vulnerability, etc.
 PERFORMANCE - Performance enhancement, that doesn't explicitly change functionality.
 DOCUMENTATION - A documentation only change 
 PIPELINE - A change to a component's own CI/CD pipeline
 -->

* **Reviewer:** Check the changes in the code against the entries in the changelog. Are all changes listed? Does the new version make sense in terms of:

    1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
    3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
